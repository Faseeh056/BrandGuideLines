Illustration

In contrast to standardized brand elements, Buffer
illustrations are more organic and playful.

We believe that illustration is a medium that shouldn't be
strictly standardized. Every illustration carries a piece of
the artist's soul, and the main goal of Buffer illustrations
is communicating a message that reflects Buffer
personality of humanity, friendships, and diversity.
The general visual style is symbolic. Flat geometric
shapes meet lines. We love metaphors. The illustrations
are minimalistic and flat. We avoid using perspective.

Photography

Photography is a powerful way to communicate Buffer
brand identity. Imagery is key to showing real human
emotions. We treat photography as a key tool to show our
diverse community. The photos we choose accurately
reflect the Buffer brand values. The colors are bright and
match the established color palette. We go for
contrasting, minimalistic style with flat color areas.

Lifestyle

We stand for authenticity. We want our photos to reflect
that. Simple and human images are the best way to
express who we are. Use cases:

â blog photos,
â various photos on website,
â social media assets,
